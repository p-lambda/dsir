Gissing revised and shortened the novel for a French edition of 1901.\n\nPlot\nThe story deals with the literary world that Gissing himself had experienced. Its title refers to the London street, Grub Street, which in the 18th century became synonymous with hack literature; by Gissing's time, Grub Street itself no longer existed, though hack-writing certainly did. Its two central characters are a sharply contrasted pair of writers: Edwin Reardon, a novelist of some talent but limited commercial prospects, and a shy, cerebral man; and Jasper Milvain, a young journalist, hard-working and capable of generosity, but cynical and only semi-scrupulous about writing and its","metadata":{"pile_set_name":"Wikipedia (en)"},"id":2}

He accepts that he will \"always despise the people [he] write[s] for,\" networks within the appropriate social circle to create opportunity, and authors articles for popular periodicals.  Reardon, on the other hand, prefers to write novels of a more literary bent and refuses to pander to contemporary tastes until, as a last-gasp measure against financial ruin, he attempts a popular novel.  At this venture, he is of course too good to succeed, and he's driven to separate from his wife, Amy Reardon, n\u00e9e Yule, who cannot accept her husband's inflexibly high standards\u2014and consequent poverty.\n\nThe Yule family includes","metadata":{"pile_set_name":"Wikipedia (en)"},"id":3}

However much Milvain respects Marian's intellectual capabilities and strength of personality, the crucial element (according to him) for marriage is missing:  money.

The association of particular bacterial groups with specific activities, initially used to determine microbial disease aetiology, has been widely successful in identifying and investigating the activities of particular bacteria throughout the biosphere. A variety of data have been used to categorize bacteria, in a number of cases governed by formal schemes such as the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria ([@r34]); however, the great diversity of the bacterial domain ([@r32]) has, to date, prevented the development of a single characterization scheme that can be readily applied","metadata":{"pile_set_name":"PubMed Central"},"id":129}

Irrespective of these debates on the nature of bacterial species, the recent widespread application of very-high-throughput sequencing technologies to bacterial populations and communities has greatly increased the necessity for a genealogical method that can work at different taxonomic levels and which can be used to assist definitions of nomenclature ([@r2]).\n\nGenotypic methods became increasingly important in bacterial characterization throughout the 20th century, complementing, and to an extent replacing, the phenotypic methods originally employed ([@r51]).

They have been widely employed in bacterial systematic and evolutionary studies, playing a seminal role in establishing the place of the bacteria in the three domains of life ([@r58]), and being widely employed in the examination of bacterial pathogens, including in diagnostic applications ([@r9]). Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene has also been used extensively in the examination of microbial communities, such as the human microbiome ([@r46]) and environmental communities ([@r36]; [@r22]; [@r21]).

Description of Related Art\nMany water cooled nuclear reactors utilize a core of vertically positioned filet assemblies within a reactor vessel. To monitor the neutron activities and coolant temperature within the core fuel assemblies, movable in-core instrumentation, such as movable neutrons detectors, conventionally enter the core from penetrations in the bottom of the vessel. In a few instances in the past, leakage occurred at the penetrations at the bottom of the vessel which","metadata":{"pile_set_name":"USPTO Backgrounds"},"id":295}

Additionally, fixed in-core neutron detectors have been employed that reside in the fuel assemblies during reactor operation. In addition to fixed in-core instrumentation that enter through penetrations in the bottom of the vessel, there are fixed in-core instrumentation that enter through penetrations in the top of the vessel. In this latter configuration, each in-core instrument thimble assembly is totally enclosed in a guide path composed of tubing.

Thus, it is therefore necessary to provide structure which can satisfactorily guide and protect the in-core instrumentation entering from the top of the vessel and mitigate the potential for leakage.\nGuidance for the instrumentation is needed through the area above the upper core plate, which is just above the fuel assemblies, to an elevation above the upper support plate which is spaced from and sits above the upper core plate, so that the in-core instrumentation can be withdrawn so its lower most extremity is at least at or about the mid plane of the upper core plate.

Emotional events such as laughter are a trigger of cataplexy in NC. We compared the volumes of key limbic structures, the amygdala and hippocampus, in 53 NC, 23 NwoC and 37 control subjects. MRI volumetry was performed in FreeSurfer (FS) and by manual delineation. We found no differences in amygdalar volume in the three groups, however, hippocampal volume was significantly smaller in the NC group than in other groups. Amygdalar and hippocampal volumes assessed by FS were significantly greater, but strong positive correlation between manual and FS results were observed. Thus, both methods are suitable for amygdalar and hippocampal volumetry.","metadata":{"pile_set_name":"PubMed Abstracts"},"id":381}

A benefit of imprinted polymers is the possibility to prepare sorbents with selectivity pre-determined for a particular substance, or group of structural analogues. The application most close to a wider acceptance is probably that of solid phase extraction for clean-up of environmental and biological samples.

Molecules capable of communication between these two tissues are known and include the signaling molecules SHH and FGF4, FGF8 and FGF10. Evidence suggests that the pattern and maintenance of expression of these genes are dependent on a number of factors including regulatory loops between genes expressed in the AER and those in the underlying mesenchyme. We show here that the mouse mutation dominant hemimelia (Dh) alters the pattern of gene expression in the AER such that Fgf4, which is normally expressed in a posterior domain, and Fgf8, which is expressed throughout are expressed in anterior patterns.

The cytoskeletal actin genes are activated at the 64-cell stage or shortly thereafter. At this stage the specification of the early embryonic lineages has just completed. M gene transcription was detected only after muscle cells appear in the late embryo.

Nonetheless defendant's assignment of error on this point must fail. The record shows that Ms. Young answered the question affirmatively before the jury notwithstanding the trial court's ruling. Defendant got the benefit of his question from the trial court's ruling. Even if the impact of the witness' answer was diminished by the ruling of the trial court, defendant has not shown any \"reasonable possibility that, had the error . . . not been committed, a different result would have been reached at the trial.\" G.S. 15A-1443(a).

The state sought to establish this identity by other evidence.\nDefendant next assigns as error the denial of his motion to dismiss the charge of rape for insufficiency of the evidence. In support of this assignment, he argues that there was no direct identification evidence and that other circumstantial evidence was insufficient to identify him as the culprit.

Ms. Young testified that she had been forced against her will to have sexual intercourse with a black male wearing a toboggan and jogging outfit while he held a long, cold, metallic object against her head which she thought was a knife but which could have been a screwdriver.

Assuming the state's evidence to be true, we hold it ample to survive defendant's motion to dismiss.\nDefendant next contends the trial court erred in charging the jury on the doctrine of recent possession as it related to the rape charge.

Second: that the defendant, Joyner, had possession of these same items of property that I have just designated; and a person possesses books and cigarettes and cigarette lighter and money, when he is aware of its presence and has, either by himself or together with others, both the power and intent to control its disposition or use.

Under the facts of this case we disagree.\nIt is well established that the \"possession of stolen property recently after the theft, and under circumstances excluding the intervening agency of others, affords presumptive evidence that the person in possession is himself the thief, and the evidence is stronger or","metadata":{"pile_set_name":"FreeLaw"},"id":784}

Frazier, 268 N.C. 249, 150 S.E.2d 431 (1966). \"The presumption, or inference as it is more properly called, is one of fact and not of law.

Ibid.\nWhile the trial judge here referred to the \"doctrine of recent possession,\" he nowhere charged that the fact of possession raised a presumption or even an inference that defendant was guilty of any of the crimes charged against him. He merely stated that the jury might consider defendant's recent possession \"together with all the other facts and circumstances in deciding whether or not the defendant is guilty of rape, burglary and larceny.\" Here the evidence tends to show that the larceny, burglary and rape all occurred at or about the same time as part of one criminal enterprise committed by the same assailant.

State v. Thorpe, 274 N.C. 457, 164 S.E.2d 171 (1968).

Whether defendant intended to commit either larceny or rape or both at the time he entered the dwelling is a fact which in this case must be inferred, if at all, from defendant's actions after he entered.

We could demonstrate both of these known adenosine responses in the in vitro perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney. Thus, 1.0 microM adenosine elicited a transient vasoconstriction blocked by 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), and 10-30 microM adenosine reversed KCl-induced vasoconstriction. However, when we examined the effects of adenosine on pressure-induced afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, we observed a third action. In this setting, a high-affinity adenosine vasodilatory response was observed at concentrations of 10-300 nM. This response was blocked by both 4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[2,3-a][1,3, 5]triazin-5-yl-amino]ethyl)phenol (ZM-241385) and glibenclamide and was mimicked by 2-phenylaminoadenosine (CV-1808)","metadata":{"pile_set_name":"PubMed Abstracts"},"id":797}

Three forms of endo-\u03b2-1,4-xylanases (XynSW1, XynSW2A, and XynSW2B) produced by thermotolerant Streptomyces sp. SWU10 have been reported. In the present study, we described the expression and characterization of the fourth xylanase enzyme from this bacteria, termed XynSW3. The gene containing 726 bp was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme (rXynSW3) was purified from cell-free extract to homogeneity using Ni-affinity column chromatography.

The memory stored the charge information and a communication means was provided to transfer the stored information to a computer system when the battery pack was installed in the computer.\nThe advantages of this system include the ability to recalculate the total capacity of the battery over time, to provide a fuel gauge to continually measure the remaining charge level of the battery at any given time and the ability to measure the battery self-discharge during periods of non-use. The local battery circuitry also controlled battery charging and used the above calculations to determine the optimal","metadata":{"pile_set_name":"USPTO Backgrounds"},"id":999}
